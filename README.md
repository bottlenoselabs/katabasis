Katabasis is built for [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) to make games using C#. It's not an engine, but rather some fundemental APIs glued together to form a *framework*. These include: playing audio, rendering of 3D and 2D graphics; and handling input such as mouse, keyboard, gamepads.

## Background: Why?

### Problem

For creating games with C#, there are a [couple options](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/games/engines). However, the majority are engines, which offer you pre-made wheels to build your car. To those who want to just create a game without focusing too much on programming, like designers or artists, this is desired. But, for those who want to take [an epic journey to hell and back for augmented knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabasis#Trip_into_the_underworld) of programming, engines can be unsatisfactory. The options which are not engines are [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) and [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA). However, both are laying bricks ontop of the [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) API. This heritage makes it more difficult than it needs to be for game developers. This is especially true considering the advancements in technology since [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) was in active development.

### Solution

Katabasis is a fork of [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA) adapted to be more modern and simple. The idea is to take and improve upon the good things of the XNA API and dump the rest. Some inspiration is also borrowed from other frameworks such as [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) and [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com). The promise is that by using Katabasis to build your game you will: have fun programming, adopt a growth mindset, and enter the gateway to computer science.
