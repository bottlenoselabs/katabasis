		/* FIXME: This whole parser is one big assumption!
		 *
		 * I basically started with what MS programs usually accept as
		 * arguments, then threw a bunch of values at XNA to see what it
		 * accepted and what it didn't.
		 *
		 * Aside from what you see below, all I could rule out was that
		 * it doesn't let you do two args as one param, and '=' is not a
		 * valid value separator either. As an example, "-r:FNA.dll"
		 * will work, "-r FNA.dll" and "-r=FNA.dll" will not.
		 *
		 * The part that bothers me the most, however, is the flag
		 * indicator. It seems to let anything through as long as : is
		 * there, but it trims some special chars, and does so pretty
		 * broadly. You can do '-', "--", "---", etc! Lastly, in
		 * addition to the chars below, I also tried '+', which didn't
		 * work. I have no idea if there are any other chars to check.
		 *
		 * If anybody has an official standard, I'd like to see it!
